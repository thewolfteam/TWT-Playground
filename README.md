# TWT Playground

Fun stuff comes here.

Based on Reloaded, which is based on etpub, which is based on etmain, which is based on rtcw, which is based on John Carmack's brain, which is based on the atomic laws of the universe ...

Organized like this: every feature will go into it's own branch. Example: you work on a fance grenade thing, gooood. But make a branch with a real good name, like "SuperGrenadeWithFartsound" and push all commits into that branch.

Useful git commands:

- TODO

Have fun!
