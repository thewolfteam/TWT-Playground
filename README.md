# TWT Playground

Fun/Crazy/Derpi stuff comes here.

Based on Reloaded, which is based on etpub, which is based on etmain, which is based on rtcw, which is based on John Carmack's brain, which is based on the atomic laws of the universe ...

Organized like this: every feature will go into its own branch. Example: you work on a fancy grenade thing, gooood. But make a branch with a real good name, like "SuperGrenadeWithFartsound" and push all commits into that branch.

Have fun!

# Working with Git

- A windows download with a cool terminal and gitk program: https://git-for-windows.github.io/

Useful git terminal commands:

- git clone https://github.com/thewolfteam/TWT-Playground.git #clones a repo (https)
- git branch #list of all branches
- git branch NAME #create a new branch locally
- git checkout BRANCHNAME #switch over to another branch
- git add FILENAME #adds a file to staging area (if i remember this name correct)
- git commit -m "message" #everything in the staging area will be commited locally
- git push origin BRANCHNAME #this pushes everything to a branch

# Install script

- there is a file called install.bat in the trunk folder. Useful for copying everything you need to the place with your ET.exe, if you work on windows.
